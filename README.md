# SST 1.0 Conf Website [![Seed Status](https://api.seed.run/anomaly/sst-v1-conf/stages/prod/build_badge)](https://console.seed.run/anomaly/sst-v1-conf)

This repo powers the [**SST 1.0 Conf**](https://v1conf.sst.dev) website. It's a simple [SST app](https://sst.dev) that's deployed through [Seed](https://seed.run). It uses the [`StaticSite`](https://docs.sst.dev/constructs/StaticSite) construct to deploy a simple static site.

#### Developing locally

Run the static site locally.

``` bash
$ yarn serve
```

Deploy the SST app.

``` bash
$ yarn deploy
```
